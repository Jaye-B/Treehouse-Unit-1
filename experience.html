        <h2>Teaching in New Jersey</h2>
         <p>My journey with education started while I was in college. While in college I started working with underserved children growing up in communities that put them at an automatic disadvantage in life.</p>
         <p>I began volunteering my time outside of school hours coaching and getting involved in the community with varying projects. This eventually led to working in after school programs for a few years.</p>
         <p>Once I graduated college I eventually went on to become a middle school English Language Arts, Special Education, and English as a Second Language Teacher.</p>

        <h2>Teaching in China</h2>
        <p>I've always known I wanted to travel, live, and work abroad. That desire was increased once I learned about the need for english language teachers in many countries abroad.</p>
        <p>I jumped at the opportunity to teach english to middle school students in China. Although my experience was quite affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, it was still an incredible opportunity I am wholeheartedly grateful for.</p>
        <p>Here is a great resource if you're interested in looking into english teaching jobs outside of the United States: <a href="https://www.eslcafe.com/" target="_blank"> Dave's ESL Cafe</a></p>
